# POKEMON EMERALD LATIN TRANSLATION

![](header.png)

This project aims to translate Pok√©mon Emerald into Latin. 
Currently, only the translation text files are hosted here. 
These files are intended to be integrated with the [Emerald Decompilation Project](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) for compilation. 
The base English text used for translation is also extracted from the Decompilation Project.
